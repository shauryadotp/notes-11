## 3.1 Introduction

As the number of discovered elements increases, there was a need of a classification system for easy study of properties of elements.

## 3.2 Döbereiner Triads
Given by **Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner** in **1817**.

**Explanation:**
He argued the elements in the group of three called **Triads**.  
The elements in a **triad** shared similar properties, and the atomic mass of the middle element was approximately the mean of the atomic masses of the other two.

**Example Given:**

| Li  | Na  | K   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7   | 23  | 39  |

$$
\frac{7 + 39}{2} = \frac{46}{2} = \boxed{23 = \text{Na}}
$$
**Limitation:**
All the elements cannot be arranged in such triads

## 3.3 Newlands' Law of Octaves
Given by **John Newlands** in **1865**.

**Explanation:**
Newlands arranged the elements in increasing order of their atomic masses and had observed that the similar properties arises after energy interval of eight elements.

**Limitation:**
This law is applicable up-to $^{40}_{20}\text{Ca}$ only.

## 3.4 Mendeleev’s Periodic Law and Table
Given by **Dmitri Mendeleev** in **1869**.

#### 3.4.1 Periodic Law
Mendeleev stated that the **physical and chemical properties** of elements are a **periodic function of their atomic masses**.
That is, when elements are arranged in increasing order of their atomic masses, **similar properties recur at regular intervals**.

#### 3.4.2 Periodic Table
Mendeleev had arranged the elements present at that time in the form of a table which contains **horizontal rows** called **periods** and **vertical columns** called **groups**

#### 3.4.3 Achievements
TBD


#### 3.4.4 Drawbacks
1. **Position of Hydrogen** was uncertain.  
   It showed similarity with both alkali metals and halogens.  
   → $\boxed{^{1}_{1}\text{H}}$

2. **Order anomaly**: At some places, the increasing atomic mass order was not followed.  
   → *Example:* Argon ($^{40}_{18}\text{Ar}$) is placed before Potassium ($^{39}_{19}\text{K}$), even though Ar has a higher mass.

3. **Isotopes issue**:  
   Mendeleev’s table couldn’t accommodate isotopes, since all isotopes of an element would have different atomic masses. 

4. **Grouping chaos**:  
   Sometimes, **dissimilar elements** were grouped together.  
   → *Example:* $^{39}_{19}\text{K}$ (alkali metal) with $^{63}_{29}\text{Cu}$ (transition metal)

5. **Similar elements split up**:  
   In certain cases, **elements with similar properties** were placed far apart.
## 3.5 Modern Periodic Law and Table
Given by **Henry Moseley** in **1913**.

#### 3.5.1 Periodic Law
It states that the physical and chemical properties of the elements are periodic functions of their atomic functions.

#### 3.5.2 Periodic Table
It was given by **Henry Moseley**.
It is composed of seven (7) horizontal rows called periods and eighteen (18) vertical columns called groups.
